## Setup

requires simplejson

```
pip install simplejson
```

Also you will need to create a sh file with the correct path to execute the file.  I would have included that file but at this time my knowledge on how to intall that file correctly in another computer is lacking.  

If you find this useful and know how to do that please contribute.  The sh file I am currently using is call boilJS.
